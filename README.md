# CIS7 Final: Breadth first, lowest cost, and shortest path
HOW TO USE:
Open the program, use w and s to move cursor and choose file, enter to select, the program will then find the solution for that file

FILE SETUP:
A character besides - or ^ on it's own will become a node (Ex: A)
The first node declared is always the start node for solving
End node is done using the - symbol (Ex: -A)
Paths are set up using ^, - and :, with 2 nodes and a number for cost (Ex: ^A-B:10)
Files must be placed in that "paths" directory where the program is being run
